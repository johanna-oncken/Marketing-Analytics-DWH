AOV Average Order Value Performance Analysis (Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To measure the performance of marketing components such as campagins and channels over time.
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track monthly 2024 trends and growth.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis. 

Queries: 
    1) AOV overall 
    2) AOV Performance monthly
    3.1) Mid of Funnel (MOFU) Monthly AOV Performance and MOM-Analysis by Channels
    3.2) Top of Funnel (TOFU) Monthly AOV Performance and MOM-Analysis by Channels
    3.3) Bottom of Funnel (BOFU) Monthly AOV Performance and MOM-Analysis by Channels
    3.4) Top 10 Improvements/Declines MoM AOV Channels
    4.1) Mid of Funnel (MOFU) Monthly AOV Performance and MOM-Analysis by Campaigns
    4.2) Top of Funnel (TOFU) Monthly AOV Performance and MOM-Analysis by Campaigns
    4.3) Bottom of Funnel (BOFU) Monthly AOV Performance and MOM-Analysis by Campaigns
