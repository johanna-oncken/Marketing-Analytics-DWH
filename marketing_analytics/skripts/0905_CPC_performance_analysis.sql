CPC Cost per Click Performance Analysis (Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To measure the CPC performance of marketing components such as campaigns and channels over time (CPC lower = better).
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track monthly 2024 trends and growth.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.

Queries: 
    1) CPC overall 
    2) CPC Performance monthly
    3.1) Monthly CPC Performance and MOM Analysis by Campaigns 
    3.2) Top Ten Campaigns by Monthly CPC Improvements 
    3.3) Top Ten Campaigns by Monthly CPC Declines 
    4.1) Monthly CPC Performance and MOM Analysis by Channels 
    4.2) Top Ten Channels by Monthly CPC Improvements 
    4.3) Top Ten Channels by Monthly CPC Declines
