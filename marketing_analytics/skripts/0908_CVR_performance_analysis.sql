CVR Conversion Rate Performance Analysis (Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To measure the CVR performance of marketing components such as campaigns and channels over time.
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track monthly 2024 trends and growth.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis. 

Queries: 
    1) CVR overall 
    2) CVR Performance monthly 
    3.1) MOFU CVR (Clicks -> Conversions) by Channel
    3.2) TOFU CVR (Impressions -> Clicks) by Channel (Please read disclaimer)
    3.3) BOFU CVR (Clicks -> Last-Touch Conversions) by Channel 
    4.1) MOFU CVR (Clicks -> Conversions) by Campaign
    4.2) TOFU CVR (Impressions -> Clicks) by Campaign (Please read disclaimer)
    4.3) BOFU CVR (Clicks -> Last-Touch Conversions) by Campaign
