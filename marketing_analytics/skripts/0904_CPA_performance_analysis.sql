===============================================================================
CPA Cost per Aquisition Performance Analysis (Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To measure the CPA performance of marketing components such as campaigns and channels over time (CPA lower = better).
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track monthly 2024 trends and growth.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis. 

Queries: 
    1) CPA overall 
    2) CPA Performance monthly
    3.1) Monthly CPA Performance and MOM Analysis by Channels 
    3.2) Top Ten Channels by Monthly CPA Improvements 
    3.3) Top Ten Channels by Monthly CPA Declines
    4.1) Monthly CPA Performance and MOM Analysis by Campaigns 
    4.2) Top Ten Campaigns by Monthly CPA Improvements 
    4.3) Top Ten Campaigns by Monthly CPA Declines
