Quality Checks
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script performs quality checks to validate the integrity, consistency, 
    and accuracy of the Gold Layer. These checks ensure:
    - Uniqueness of surrogate keys in dimension tables.
    - Referential integrity between fact and dimension tables.
    - Validation of relationships in the data model for analytical purposes.

Usage Notes:
    - Investigate and resolve any discrepancies found during the checks.
